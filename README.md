# AVL-tree-scheduling
This project involved coding my own AVL Tree implementation for CSCI 104 Data Structured and Introduction to OOP. My implementation involved Binary Search Tree functionality as well as AVL Tree rotate functionality. This was used in my scheduling program that organized students' courses and time slots into cohesive schedules.
